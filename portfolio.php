							<h2>Project 1 for CSC174- Regional Food</h2>
							<p>
								Project 1's focus was to work as a team to build a website centered around one topic. Our team chose Regional Foods to be our topic because there were several subpage ideas steming from that topic. Each team member had an individual role. My role was the team architect. 
							</p>

							<h2>Digital Media Projects</h2>
							<p>
								For an intro to digital media course, I had to complete various projects across several topics. Some of these projects included 3D printing, photography, graphic design, and video game design. At the end of the course, we created a portfolio for all of our work.
							</p>
							<p>
								The link to the complete portfolio can be found <a href="https://mlakis.wordpress.com/">here</a>.

							<h2>Lab 9 for CSC174</h2>
							<p>
								Lab 9 focused on the different dynamic content layouts websites use to grab users' attentions, including the Z and F Pattern. In this lab, we worked with a partner to create a website following these patterns. Our website topic was the Toy Story series.
							</p>

							<h2>Project 2 for CSC174- New York Rangers</h2>
							<p>
								Project 2 is similar to Project 1; however, we instead redesigned certain aspects of another team's website according to their needs and wants. We were given a list of what they wanted fix and tried our best to do so.
